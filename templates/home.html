                <h1>KMP for genome pattern matching</h1>
                <p class="about">
                    This web application was developed to perform sequence pattern matching on a genome, which is a common task in the field of computational biology and bioinformatics. <br><br>
                    The algorithm that has been implemented to perform this task is the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm, which is widely used in computer science since it speeds up the computational time of string matching, compared to the brute force method of a na√Øve algorithm. <br> Therefore it is suitable for processing large amounts of data, such as genomic data. <br><br>
                    The genome on which the pattern is searched for and matched is the one coming from the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2?report=fasta" target="_blank">NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2</a>), which is the first complete sequencing of the virus that was published on 3rd February 2020 and made publicly available. <br><br>
                    The application allows the user to type a short nucleotide sequence and it retrieves the number of times where the sequence has matched on the genome.
